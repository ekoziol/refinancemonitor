## Introduction

You've seen the headlines about falling mortgage rates and you're wondering: is it time to refinance? The answer lies in one simple calculation that takes less than five minutes to complete.

Your break-even point tells you exactly how many months it takes for your monthly savings to exceed your closing costs. Once you know this number, the decision becomes straightforward: if you'll stay in your home longer than your break-even period, refinancing makes financial sense.

This guide provides a quick, step-by-step method to calculate your break-even point using just four numbers you can gather in minutes. We'll also cover the one critical factor that most homeowners forget: what happens when you extend your loan term.

## The 5-Minute Break-Even Calculation

You need just four numbers to calculate your break-even point:

1. Your current monthly principal and interest payment
2. Your new monthly principal and interest payment (get a quote or estimate)
3. Your estimated closing costs
4. How long you plan to stay in your home

### Step 1: Find Your Current Payment (30 seconds)

Pull up your mortgage statement or online portal. Find your monthly principal and interest payment. Don't include escrow amounts for taxes and insurance; these remain the same after refinancing.

**Your current P&I payment: $________**

Example: $2,175

### Step 2: Get Your New Payment Estimate (2 minutes)

You can get this from:
- A lender quote
- An online mortgage calculator
- Our [refinancing calculator](/calculators/refinancing)

Enter your current loan balance and the new interest rate. Use a 30-year term for this initial calculation.

**Your new P&I payment: $________**

Example: $1,925

### Step 3: Calculate Monthly Savings (10 seconds)

Subtract your new payment from your current payment.

```
Monthly Savings = Current Payment - New Payment
```

**Your monthly savings: $________**

Example: $2,175 - $1,925 = $250

### Step 4: Estimate Closing Costs (1 minute)

For a quick estimate, use 2-3% of your loan amount. For a $350,000 loan, that's $7,000-$10,500.

For a more accurate number, request a Loan Estimate from a lender.

**Your estimated closing costs: $________**

Example: $8,500

### Step 5: Calculate Break-Even (10 seconds)

Divide your closing costs by your monthly savings.

```
Break-Even Point = Closing Costs / Monthly Savings
```

**Your break-even point: ________ months**

Example: $8,500 / $250 = 34 months

### Step 6: Make Your Decision (30 seconds)

Compare your break-even point to how long you plan to stay:

| Break-Even | Time in Home | Decision |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| 34 months | 5+ years | Refinance |
| 34 months | 3 years | Don't refinance |
| 34 months | Uncertain | Consider carefully |

## Quick Reference: Break-Even Cheat Sheet

Don't want to do the math? Use this table for quick estimates based on a $350,000 loan:

| Rate Drop | Est. Monthly Savings | Est. Break-Even (2.5% costs) |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| 0.25% | $55 | 159 months (13 years) |
| 0.50% | $110 | 80 months (6.5 years) |
| 0.75% | $165 | 53 months (4.4 years) |
| 1.00% | $220 | 40 months (3.3 years) |
| 1.25% | $275 | 32 months (2.7 years) |
| 1.50% | $330 | 27 months (2.2 years) |
| 2.00% | $440 | 20 months (1.7 years) |

Larger loans break even faster. Smaller loans take longer.

## The Factor Most People Forget: Term Reset

The basic calculation above is useful, but it ignores something critical: what happens when you restart your loan term.

If you're 5 years into a 30-year mortgage and refinance into a new 30-year mortgage, you've just added 5 years of payments. Even with a lower rate, you may pay more total interest over the life of the loan.

### The True Cost Example

**Current Situation:**
- Original loan: $400,000 at 7.0%
- 5 years in, balance: $372,000
- Remaining payments: 25 years
- Total remaining interest: ~$225,000

**Option A: Refinance to new 30-year at 6.0%**
- New payment: $2,231 (down from $2,661)
- Monthly savings: $430
- But: Total interest over 30 years: ~$431,000
- Net result: Pay $206,000 MORE in total interest

**Option B: Refinance to 25-year at 6.0%**
- New payment: $2,397 (down from $2,661)
- Monthly savings: $264
- Total interest over 25 years: ~$347,000
- Net result: Save $78,000 in total interest

**Option C: Refinance to 30-year but pay as if it's 25-year**
- Pay $2,661 (your old payment) on the new loan
- Pay off in ~22 years instead of 30
- Net result: Save $150,000+ in total interest

### Adjusted Break-Even Calculation

For a more accurate picture, calculate break-even using Option C's approach:

```
Adjusted Monthly Savings = Current Payment - (New Payment + Extra Principal)
```

If you continue paying your current payment amount:
- The "savings" you keep in pocket is $0 per month
- But you pay off the loan years faster
- The "break-even" becomes about total cost, not monthly cash flow

**Bottom Line:** If your goal is wealth-building rather than cash flow relief, consider a shorter term or commit to making extra payments.

## Common Scenarios Calculated

### Scenario 1: Rate-and-Term Refinance

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current balance | $300,000 |
| Current rate | 7.25% |
| New rate | 6.25% |
| Closing costs | $7,500 |
| Current payment | $2,046 |
| New payment | $1,847 |
| Monthly savings | $199 |
| **Break-even** | **38 months** |

**Recommendation:** If staying 4+ years, refinance.

### Scenario 2: Cash-Out Refinance

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current balance | $250,000 |
| Cash out | $50,000 |
| New loan | $300,000 |
| Current rate | 6.5% |
| New rate | 6.75% |
| Closing costs | $9,000 |
| Current payment | $1,580 |
| New payment | $1,946 |
| Monthly change | +$366 |
| **Break-even** | **N/A** |

**Note:** Cash-out refinances don't have a traditional break-even because your payment increases. Instead, evaluate whether the cash is worth the added monthly cost and whether the use of funds (debt consolidation, renovation, etc.) provides value exceeding the cost.

### Scenario 3: Eliminating PMI

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current balance | $280,000 |
| Current rate | 6.75% + $185 PMI |
| New rate | 6.50%, no PMI |
| Closing costs | $7,000 |
| Current payment (with PMI) | $2,002 |
| New payment | $1,770 |
| Monthly savings | $232 |
| **Break-even** | **30 months** |

**Recommendation:** Strong candidate for refinancing if staying 3+ years.

## When the Math Doesn't Work

Not every refinance makes sense. Here's when to walk away:

### Break-Even Exceeds Stay Duration

If you're planning to move in 3 years and your break-even is 4 years, refinancing loses money.

### Minimal Rate Improvement

A 0.25% rate drop rarely justifies closing costs unless your loan is very large ($500,000+).

### Deep Into Your Current Loan

If you're 20 years into a 30-year mortgage, most of your payment already goes to principal. A rate reduction has minimal impact, and extending the term destroys your progress.

### High Closing Costs in Your State

In states like New York with high mortgage recording taxes, the break-even calculation may show refinancing only makes sense with significant rate drops (1%+).

## Quick Action Steps

1. **Right now (2 minutes):** Gather your current payment and loan balance from your mortgage statement

2. **Today (5 minutes):** Use our [calculator](/calculators/break-even) to find your break-even at current market rates

3. **This week:** If break-even looks favorable, get actual quotes from 2-3 lenders

4. **If rates aren't there yet:** Set up a [rate alert](/alerts) at your target rate

---

## Conclusion

Calculating your break-even point takes five minutes and answers the fundamental question of whether refinancing makes sense. The formula is simple:

```
Break-Even = Closing Costs / Monthly Savings
```

Remember to consider:
- How long you'll stay in your home
- Whether you're extending your loan term
- Your state's specific closing costs

If your break-even point is shorter than your planned stay, refinancing is likely worthwhile. If it's longer, wait for better rates or lower closing costs.
