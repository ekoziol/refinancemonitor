# RefiAlert Business Model & Unit Economics

## Executive Summary

RefiAlert operates in the mortgage refinance monitoring space, helping homeowners identify optimal refinancing opportunities. After analyzing four business models, we recommend a **Hybrid Model** that combines subscription revenue with lead generation for maximum LTV and sustainable growth.

**Target: $10M ARR by Year 3**

---

## Market Context

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- **52M+ mortgage holders** in the US
- **$12T total mortgage debt**
- **~$4.5M homeowners refinance annually** (varies with rates)
- **Mortgage lead generation market**: $5B+

### Market Timing
- Rate volatility creates urgency for refinance monitoring
- Average homeowner checks rates 2-3x/year manually
- Automated monitoring solves a real pain point
- Competition is fragmented (no dominant player)

---

## Business Model Options Analysis

### Model 1: Pure SaaS Subscription

**Structure:**
- Tiered pricing: $9.99/mo (Basic), $19.99/mo (Pro), $29.99/mo (Premium)
- Feature differentiation by tier
- Annual discount (20% off)

**Pros:**
- Predictable recurring revenue
- Simple to understand and sell
- High gross margins (80%+)
- Clear value proposition

**Cons:**
- Limited LTV if users cancel after refinancing
- Average subscription duration: 6-18 months
- High churn risk at rate decision points
- CAC recovery requires 3-6 months

**Unit Economics:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| ARPU | $19/month |
| Avg Lifetime | 10 months |
| LTV | $190 |
| Target CAC | $50-75 |
| LTV:CAC | 2.5-3.8x |

**Verdict:** Viable but leaves money on the table. Users who refinance represent significant unrealized value.

---

### Model 2: Freemium + Upsell

**Structure:**
- **Free Tier:** Calculator, 1 active alert, weekly email digest
- **Pro ($19/mo):** Unlimited alerts, daily notifications, rate history
- **Premium ($49/mo):** Expert consultation, priority support, advanced analytics

**Pros:**
- Low barrier to entry
- Viral potential (free users refer paid users)
- Natural upgrade path
- Large top-of-funnel

**Cons:**
- Free tier cannibalization risk
- Higher infrastructure costs for free users
- Conversion rates typically 2-5%
- Longer path to profitability

**Unit Economics:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Free:Paid Ratio | 20:1 |
| Conversion Rate | 5% |
| Avg Paid ARPU | $24/month |
| Effective ARPU | $1.20/user |

**Verdict:** Good for growth, challenging for early-stage unit economics. Better suited for well-funded scale-up phase.

---

### Model 3: Lead Generation (B2B)

**Structure:**
- Free tools and alerts for consumers
- Monetize through lender partnerships
- Revenue: $200-800 per closed refinance loan
- Qualified lead definition: Verified equity, intent signal, rate threshold met

**Pros:**
- Highest revenue per user action
- Aligns incentives (user gets refinanced, we get paid)
- Large established market ($5B+)
- No user payment friction

**Cons:**
- Complex lender relationships to establish
- Regulatory compliance requirements (RESPA, TCPA)
- Quality control challenges
- Revenue timing lag (60-90 days to close)

**Unit Economics:**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Lead Price | $50-150 (form fill) |
| Closed Loan Revenue | $400-800 (CPA) |
| Conversion Rate | 15-25% |
| Revenue/Qualified Lead | $60-200 |

**Verdict:** Highest revenue potential but requires compliance infrastructure and lender network. Best combined with direct revenue.

---

### Model 4: Hybrid Model (RECOMMENDED)

**Structure:**
- **Consumer Revenue:** $19/mo subscription for active alerts
- **B2B Revenue:** Lender affiliate partnerships for refinance completions
- **Dual Monetization:** Same user can generate both subscription + affiliate revenue

**Why Hybrid Wins:**

1. **Double-dip economics:** $228/year subscription + $400 affiliate = $628 potential LTV
2. **Aligned incentives:** We want users to refinance (commission), users want to refinance (savings)
3. **Reduced churn impact:** Even if user cancels after refinancing, we captured affiliate revenue
4. **Multiple revenue streams:** Diversified risk

**Tier Structure:**
| Tier | Price | Features | Affiliate |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Free | $0 | Calculator only | Yes |
| Basic | $9/mo | 1 alert, email digest | Yes |
| Pro | $19/mo | Unlimited alerts, SMS | Yes |
| Premium | $49/mo | Expert consultation | Priority |

## Unit Economics Deep Dive (Hybrid Model)

### Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC)

| Channel | CAC | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Organic Search (SEO) | $15-25 | Long-term investment, best ROI |
| Content Marketing | $20-35 | Calculator traffic, blog |
| Social (Organic) | $25-40 | Community building |
| Google Ads (Brand) | $40-60 | High intent |
| Google Ads (Generic) | $80-150 | Competitive keywords |
| Facebook/Meta | $50-100 | Audience targeting |
| Referral Program | $30-50 | Existing user incentive |
| **Blended CAC** | **$50** | Target with channel mix |

### Lifetime Value (LTV) Calculation

**Subscription Component:**
```
Monthly ARPU: $19
Average Lifetime: 12 months
Gross Margin: 85%
Subscription LTV: $19 × 12 × 0.85 = $194
```

**Affiliate Component:**
```
Users who refinance: 25%
Affiliate revenue per close: $400
Affiliate LTV: 0.25 × $400 = $100
```

**Combined LTV:**
```
Total LTV = $194 + $100 = $294
LTV:CAC Ratio = $294 / $50 = 5.9x
```

### Payback Period

```
Monthly Revenue: $19 + ($100/12) = $27.33
Blended CAC: $50
Payback Period: 50 / 27.33 = 1.8 months
```

### Cohort Economics

| Month | Retained | MRR/User | Cumulative Revenue |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | 100% | $19 | $19 |
| 3 | 85% | $19 | $55 |
| 6 | 70% | $19 | $101 |
| 12 | 50% | $19 | $170 |
| 18 | 35% | $19 | $216 |
| 24 | 25% | $19 | $253 |

*Note: Affiliate revenue typically realized in months 6-18 when users complete refinance*
