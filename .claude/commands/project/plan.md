   - Identify dependencies and potential blockers
   - Estimate complexity and effort required

2. **Technical Design**:
   - Design the solution architecture
   - Identify which domains/components will be affected
   - Plan database schema changes if needed
   - Consider performance and scalability implications

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Create step-by-step implementation plan
